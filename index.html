            when i was here i caught nothing but somebody else caught a trout.
            <br>
            there are not a lot of shore fishing spots
            <br>
            the snags are unbearable, becuase of that i would recomend a top water bait.
            <br>
            so i rate this 4 out of ten, but the lake is very pretty.
            there is a nice selection of fish at this lake better than most.
